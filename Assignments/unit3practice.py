# Booleam Expression
# Kinda likde a mathematical formula 
# Can only evaluate to true or false 
# Are my shoes tied? = True
# is 5 > 7 = False
print(5 > 7)

# Comparison operators! == > < >= <=
#Kinda like arithmetic operators! + - / * ** % //
x = 5               # SET x equal to 5, tell it what to be 
print(x == 5)       #FET x equals t, ask a question 
#The difference is that we are using ome or two rqual signs 
#This is a Perfect test question

print(4 >= 2)        # True
print(1993 == 1993)  # True 
print(-90 < -99)     # False
print(10 != 10) # False, "bash" "not" 
print
